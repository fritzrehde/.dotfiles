# What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are the customisation files that are used to personalise Unix-based systems. Dotfiles are hidden files or directories which have names that start with a dot/period.\
This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I can quickly access them on new machines. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.
