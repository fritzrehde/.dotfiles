# Dotfiles
![Example Setup](screenshot.png)

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are the configuration files that are used to personalise Unix-based systems. Dotfiles are hidden files or directories which have names that start with a dot/period.\
This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I can quickly access them on new machines. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customising their own dotfiles.

## Featured applications
* [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim): [`nvim/`](../.config/nvim)
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): [`.tmux.conf`](../.tmux.conf)
